- ## Abstract

 * Both microplastic and biofilm are contamination sources in drinking water, but their integrated impacts on water quality have been rarely studied, especially in drinking water distribution pipes with complex hydraulic conditions. This study explored the impacts of hydraulic conditions (0–2 m/s) on microplastic biofilm (MP-BM) development, shear stresses distribution, and microbial community structures. The research was conducted for two weeks using a pilot test device to simulate practical water pipes. The following were the primary conclusions: (1) According to morphology analysis, clusters (>5 μm) significantly increased in the plastisphere when the flow velocity ranged from 0.55 m/s to 0.95 m/s, and average size of clusters decreased when the flow velocity ranged from 1.14 m/s to 1.40 m/s (2) Characteristics of MP-BM impact shear stress on both plastisphere and pipe wall biofilm. Shear stresses were positively correlated with flow velocity, number of MP-BM, and size of MP-BM, while negatively correlated with diameters of pipes. (3) 31 genera changed strictly and monotonously with the fluid velocity, accounting for 15.42%. Opportunistic pathogens in MP-BM such as Sediminibacterium, Curvibacter, and Flavobacterium were more sensitive to hydraulic conditions. Moreover, microplastics (<100 μm) deserve more attention to avoid human ingestion and to prevent mechanical damage and bio-chemical risks.
