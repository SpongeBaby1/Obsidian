- ## Abstract

 * Purpose of Reviewâ€‚ In the context of COVID-19 sweeping the world, the development of microbial disinfection methods in gas, liquid, and solid media has received widespread attention from researchers. As a disinfection technology that can adapt to different environmental media, microwave-assisted disinfection has the advantages of strong permeability, no secondary pollution, etc. The purpose of this review is to put forward new development requirements for future microwave disinfection strategies by summarizing current microwave disinfection methods and effects. From the perspective of the interaction mechanism of microwave and microorganisms, this review provides a development direction for more accurate and microscopic disinfection mechanism research.
