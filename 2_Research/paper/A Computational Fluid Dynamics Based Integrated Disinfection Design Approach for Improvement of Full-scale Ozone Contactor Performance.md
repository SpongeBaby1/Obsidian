- ## Abstract

 * A three-dimensional multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been developed, to address all the major components of ozone disinfection processes at the Charles DesBaillets Water Treatment Plant in MontreÂ´al, Canada. Good agreement was observed between the numerical results and full-scale tracer data. The CFD predicted flow fields showed that recirculation zones and short circuiting existed in the DesBaillets contactors. Installation of four additional baffles in the second chamber would significantly improve contactor mixing performance. The modeling results also indicated that ozone residuals at the cross section of the outlet of each chamber were very sensitive to the locations of monitoring points.
