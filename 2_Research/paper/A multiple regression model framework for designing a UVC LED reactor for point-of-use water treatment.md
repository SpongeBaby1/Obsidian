- ## Abstract

UVC LED technology has been introduced for drinking water treatment because of advantages including
its flexible wavelength range, smaller form factor, low susceptibility to power cycling and long lifespan.
However, designing a reactor utilizing UVC LEDs is still a challenging task. In this study, we proposed a
systematic framework for designing a UVC LED reactor for microbial inactivation for point-of-use (POU)
water treatment. By combining computational fluid dynamics, optical ray tracing and Lagrangian particle
tracing models, we established a baseline multiphysics UV fluence model, and then converted UV fluence
to logarithmic reduction values (LRVs) via microbial inactivation kinetic equations. The simulation was
validated (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05) against biodosimetry using bacteriophage QÎ². A two-level full
factorial design-of-experiments (DOE) was conducted on eight operating and design variables for the
reactor with a total of 256 combinations based on the multiphysics model. Four main effects including the
flow rate, water UV transmittance, LED radiant power and viewing angle pattern were identified to have
significant impacts on reactor microbial inactivation efficiency. Multiple regression predictive models were
derived after DOE analysis to include two-way and three-way interactions among six design variables with
predictive accuracies being 82.2% and 90.6%, respectively. Finally, the multiphysics model and multiple
regression models were validated again via biodosimetry on a newly constructed reactor and the results
showed great agreement (p < 0.05).
